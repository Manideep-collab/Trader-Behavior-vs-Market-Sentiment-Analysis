# Trader Behavior vs Market Sentiment

**Primetrade.ai – Data Science Intern Assignment**

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains an end-to-end analysis exploring the relationship between Bitcoin market sentiment (Fear vs. Greed) and trader behavior on the Hyperliquid exchange. By combining a proprietary trade-level dataset with daily sentiment indices, the project evaluates how regime shifts influence profitability, trading intensity, and risk exposure. The end goal is to surface actionable, regime‑aware strategies and to demonstrate a prototype decision‑support dashboard.

## 📁 Repository Structure
```
├── fear_greed_index.csv      # Daily Fear & Greed Index values
├── historical_data.csv       # Raw trade‑level transaction records (~211k rows)
├── PrimeTrade.ipynb          # Jupyter notebook containing the full analysis
├── Summary.md                # Executive summary of key findings and recommendations
├── README.md                 # This documentation file
```

*Additional artifacts such as model outputs and visualizations are generated dynamically by the notebook and dashboard.*

## 🧰 Dependencies
The analysis was developed in a Python 3.8+ environment. Key libraries include:

- pandas, numpy – data manipulation
- matplotlib, seaborn – visualization
- scikit‑learn – predictive modeling & clustering
- streamlit – interactive dashboard

You can install all required packages via `pip`:[/code]

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> ⚠️ _Note_: A `requirements.txt` file can be autogenerated from the notebook environment if needed.

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:  
   `git clone <repo-url>`
2. **Activate a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```powershell
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. **Install dependencies** as shown above.
4. **Inspect the notebook** (`PrimeTrade.ipynb`) using JupyterLab, VS Code, or another Jupyter viewer. Execute cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.
5. **View executive summary** in `Summary.md` for a high‑level narrative of results and recommendations.
6. **Launch interactive dashboard** (if the Streamlit app files are present or the notebook contains the code):
   ```bash
   streamlit run path/to/dashboard.py
   ```
   _(The notebook contains an example Streamlit implementation.)_

## 📊 Data Sources
- **fear_greed_index.csv** – Daily Bitcoin sentiment readings scraped from the public Fear & Greed Index (0–100 scale) with categorical regimes.
- **historical_data.csv** – Aggregated trade-level activity from Hyperliquid covering every executed order, including account identifiers, PnL, trade size, side, and timestamps.

Both files are proprietary to the internship assignment and contain synthetic/anonymized data for confidentiality.

## 🔍 Key Findings
A full summary of analytical insights is available in `Summary.md`. Highlights include:

- Profitability differences between Fear and Greed regimes are present but not statistically strong.  
- Volatility (PnL dispersion) is significantly higher during Fear periods.  
- Traders increase activity and risk-taking when sentiment turns fearful.  
- High‑activity accounts exhibit greater regime sensitivity than low‑activity ones.  
- Sentiment offers modest predictive signal, with a logistic regression model achieving ~66% accuracy. 
- Clustering reveals three behavioral archetypes, from controlled to high‑risk traders.

Strategic recommendations focus on **dynamic, regime‑aware risk management** rather than fixed directional bets.

## 📈 Extensions & Usage
- Extend the predictive model with additional features (leverage, multi‑asset data).  
- Incorporate real-time sentiment feeds for live strategy backtesting.  
- Deploy the Streamlit dashboard as an internal tool for traders or risk teams.
